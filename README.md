## 📋 Overview

This software suite is designed for remote cognitive testing research, specifically measuring:
- Visual and audio reaction times
- Working memory performance across multiple iterations
- Hardware validation (framerate stability, keyboard consistency)
- Performance tracking under mental fatigue conditions

**Key Feature:** Designed for elderly participants with large fonts, validation retry dialogs, and comprehensive error handling, also has user controlled sections ie. length of time for certain sections, number of reaction images/audio clips displayed, time between clips, etc. it is near the top of the code for easy access and edit.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Test Configuration (Lines 49-92)

Edit these variables to customize testing:

```python
# Reaction test trials
NUM_ITERATIONS = 2  # Number of RT trials (increase for more data)
INTERVAL_MIN = 1.5  # Minimum seconds between stimuli
INTERVAL_MAX = 3.0  # Maximum seconds between stimuli

# Memory test settings
MEMORY_POOL_SIZE = 30  # Total unique images
MEMORY_SET_1_SIZE = 10  # Images to memorize in set 1
MEMORY_SET_2_SIZE = 10  # Images to memorize in set 2
MEMORY_SET_1_STUDY_TIME = 5.0  # Study time in seconds (300 = 5 min)
MEMORY_SET_2_STUDY_TIME = 5.0  # Study time in seconds

# Enable/disable test sections
RUN_CONSENT_SCREEN = True
RUN_PERFORMANCE_CHECKLIST = True
RUN_DATA_GATHERING = True
RUN_FRAMERATE_TEST = True
RUN_KEYBOARD_TEST = True
RUN_AUDIO_VERIFICATION = True
RUN_VISUAL_TEST = True
RUN_AUDIO_TEST = True
RUN_MEMORY_TEST_1 = True
RUN_MEMORY_TEST_2 = True
```

### Developer Mode
Enter `"e"` as Name to bypass validation (for testing).

## 🎯 Performance Optimizations

### Code Optimizations
- **Deferred dropped frame calculation** - Calculated after test, not during
- **Deferred performance logging** - RT tests log after trial completion
- **Minimal measurement loops** - ~0.3ms overhead per frame (all tests)
- **GPU pre-warm** - 10s initialization for consistent performance
- **Static text rendering** - Text set once, not updated during measurement

### Recommended System Setup
- Close all background applications
- Disable Windows updates during test
- Disable antivirus real-time scanning (or add exception)
- Plug in device (not on battery)
- Use wired keyboard and mouse
- Use maximum performance power plan
- Enable both dGPU + iGPU on hybrid systems (best results!)

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "POOR" Framerate Rating
1. Close all background apps
2. Enable both dGPU + iGPU (if hybrid GPU system)
3. Set power plan to "High Performance"
4. Check GPU isn't thermal throttling
5. Restart and try again

### Keyboard Test Keeps Failing
1. Use wired USB keyboard (not wireless)
2. Start tapping IMMEDIATELY when "START TAPPING NOW!" appears
3. Tap continuously without pausing
4. Use one finger from one hand only

### SmartScreen Warning (When Running .exe)
**This is normal for unsigned executables.**
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"
3. Program is safe - SmartScreen warns about any unsigned .exe

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Timing Precision
- **Framerate measurement:** V-sync enabled, dropped frame detection
- **RT measurement:** Timestamps captured immediately on key press
- **Error calculation:** Individual per trial (frame time + input latency)
- **Typical accuracy:** ±1-2ms system latency

### Dynamic UI Scaling
- **Reference resolution:** 2560x1600 (16:10)
- **Scales to:** Any resolution (1080p, 1440p, 4K tested)
- **Aspect ratio handling:** Adjusts for 16:9, 16:10, 4:3 screens
- **DPI aware:** Works with Windows 100%-300% scaling

### Memory Test Design
- 30 unique images (shapes, colors, patterns)
- Randomized presentation order each iteration
- Click tracking (confidence measurement)
- Green border selection feedback
